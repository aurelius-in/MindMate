## Architecture

The MindMate chatbot is based on a client-server model. The client is a web page or application that hosts the chat interface, while the server is responsible for processing the user's input and generating appropriate responses.

The chatbot utilizes various APIs or external services, such as sentiment analysis tools or text-to-speech converters, to enhance its functionality. The server-side code for processing the user's input and generating responses is implemented using Node.js and Express.

Overall, the MindMate AI therapist chatbot is designed to provide an engaging and personalized experience for users, utilizing a variety of AI and machine learning components to generate appropriate responses based on the user's input and emotional state.
