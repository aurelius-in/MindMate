## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

The NLP component of the chatbot analyzes and understands the text input from the user. This involves breaking down the user's input into individual words, identifying the parts of speech, and determining the meaning and intent behind the text.

The NLP algorithms used in the MindMate chatbot are based on rule-based and statistical models, combined with natural language processing techniques. These algorithms are implemented using JavaScript code, such as the code found in the `sentiment_analyst.js` file.
