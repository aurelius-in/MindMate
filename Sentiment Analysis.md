## Sentiment Analysis

The sentiment analysis component of the chatbot analyzes the user's input to determine the sentiment or emotion being expressed. This is useful for generating appropriate responses that match the user's mood or emotional state.

The sentiment analysis tools used in the MindMate chatbot are based on machine learning models, such as support vector machines (SVM) or neural networks. These models are trained on a dataset of labeled examples to learn how to classify text according to its sentiment. The code for implementing sentiment analysis in the chatbot is found in the `sentiment_analyst.js` file.
