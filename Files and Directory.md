# MindMate AI Therapist Files

To build MindMate, an AI therapist that interacts with patients like a therapist and displays a series of facial expressions, you will need the following files and directories:

- `index.html` - the main web page file that handles the interaction with the patient and displays the facial expressions
- `facial_expression.js` - a JavaScript module that defines the facial expression class and methods for displaying different expressions
- `patient_data.json` - a JSON file that defines the patient data class and stores patient information
- `therapist_data.json` - a JSON file that defines the therapist data class and stores therapist information, including the images of their face for the facial expressions
- `sentiment_analysis.js` - a JavaScript module that implements a sentiment analysis algorithm to determine the patient's emotional state based on their input
- `speech_to_text.js` - a JavaScript module that converts the patient's spoken input into text for processing
- `text_to_speech.js` - a JavaScript module that converts the AI's responses into spoken output for the patient
- `images/` - a directory containing the images of the therapist's face for the facial expressions
- `data/` - a directory containing the patient and therapist data files

You can display MindMate as a web page on your local hard drive by opening the `index.html` file in a web browser. Make sure all the required files and directories are in the same folder as the `index.html` file.
