			Welcome to our virtual therapy session. I'm MindMate, your virtual therapist. Do you mind telling me what brings you here today?
		</div>
		<div class="user">
			Hi MindMate, I'm here today because I'm feeling really annoyed with my mother. She's always criticizing me and it's really getting to me. I feel like I can't do anything right and it's making me feel really down.
		</div>
		<div class="mindmate">
			I'm sorry to hear that you're going through that. It sounds like her behavior is having a real impact on your mental well-being.
		</div>
		<div class="user">
			Yes, it is. I just don't know how to deal with it anymore.
		</div>
		<div class="mindmate">
			I understand why you might be feeling concerned. Have you tried talking to your mother about how you feel?
		</div>
		<div class="user">
			Yes, but she just dismisses my feelings and tells me to toughen up.
		</div>
		<div class="mindmate">
			That's unexpected. Tell me more. How does that make you feel when she responds that way?
		</div>
		<div class="user">
			It makes me feel like my feelings don't matter and that I'm not important.
		</div>
		<div class="mindmate">
			I can see why you would feel that way. It's important to remember that your feelings are valid and deserve to be heard.
		</div>
		<div class="user">
			Thank you, that's really helpful to hear.
		</div>
		<div class="mindmate">
			I'm here to listen. Let's talk about strategies to deal with these feelings. Have you tried any mindfulness techniques to help manage your stress and anxiety?
		</div>
		<div class="user">
			No, I haven't. Can you recommend one?
		</div>
