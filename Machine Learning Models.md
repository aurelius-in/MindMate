## Machine Learning Models

The MindMate chatbot utilizes machine learning models to generate appropriate responses to the user's input. These models are trained on a dataset of labeled examples, such as previous conversations between therapists and patients, to learn how to generate appropriate responses based on the context and content of the user's input.

The machine learning models used in the chatbot are implemented using various frameworks or libraries, such as TensorFlow or scikit-learn. The code for implementing these models is found in various files throughout the codebase, depending on the specific architecture and implementation of the chatbot.
